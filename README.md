# What the heck is this clock displaying?!

The clock is probably useless to anyone but me. I have an odd obsession with numerals and clocks and other such things, and this particular clock represents one point in that obsession-space.

If you sweep away all the arbitrary time constructs we use (weeks, hours, etc.) you are left with a small number of things that actually exist – years (the duration of a planet’s orbit around its sun), days (the duration of a planet’s rotation), and possibly also some lunar cycle. These are all completely independent of each other (some planets have days that are longer than their years) which makes unifying them into one time system rather complex. EG, “month” refers to the lunar cycle, but the month in the Gregorian calendar does a pretty poor job of tracking the moon.

There is a lot more explanation to add …

# Options

There are various options described in `options.h` that you can change to adjust the behavior.

# NOTE:

The required font resource isn’t included in the repository. This is because I don’t have a license to distribute the Hoefler Text font. You will have to add this file yourself before building. It is included with Mac OS X. If you don’t have access to this font, you may substitute [something similar](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/17347/can-anyone-suggest-a-free-equivalent-of-the-hoefler-text-font), but it may mean adjusting some of the `TextLayer`s to make things fit.
